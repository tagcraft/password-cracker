🔐 Password Cracker in C++
📌 Project Overview

This project is a password cracking tool implemented in C++ to demonstrate how insecure password storage mechanisms can be exploited.
It is inspired by tools like John the Ripper and CrackStation and is built purely for educational purposes.

The project helps understand:
How password hashing works
Why weak hashing algorithms like MD5 are insecure
How attackers crack passwords using different techniques
Why modern systems use salting and slow hashes

⚙️ Features Implemented

✔ MD5 Hashing
✔ Brute Force Attack
✔ Dictionary (Wordlist) Attack
✔ Rainbow Table Generation
✔ Rainbow Table Based Password Cracking

🛠️ Technologies Used

Language: C++
Hashing Algorithm: MD5 (via OpenSSL)
Compiler: g++
Platform: Linux (GitHub Codespaces / Ubuntu)

🔎 Attack Methods Explained
🔸 Brute Force Attack

Tries all possible character combinations up to a fixed length
Guaranteed success for short passwords
Very slow for longer passwords

🔸 Dictionary Attack

Uses a wordlist of commonly used passwords
Much faster than brute force
Relies on human password patterns

🔸 Rainbow Table Attack

Precomputes hashes and stores them in a file
Cracks passwords instantly using hash lookup
Demonstrates why unsalted hashes are insecure

🎓 Learning Outcomes

Understanding password hashing
Difference between brute force and optimized attacks
File handling in C++
Hash maps for fast lookups
Real-world cybersecurity concepts
